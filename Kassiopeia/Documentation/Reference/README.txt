This README is for developers updating the Kassiopiea documentation.

The built-in documentation (doxygen) for Kassiopeia can be
made in the same way as any other Kasper module by running:

$ make reference-Kassiopeia

from the build directory. The results will be written to <KASPERSYS>/doc/Kassiopeia/Reference.

The stand-alone Kassiopeia user's guide on the other hand uses Sphinx and restructuredText.
To generate an hmtl document, it can be built using:

$ make user-reference-Kassiopeia

The results will be written to <KASPERSYS>/doc/Kassiopeia/UserGuide. Calling this command will
also build the doxygen API documentation at the same time and incorporate it into the Sphinx html.

Alternatively, you should be able to compile a latex-source document by hand (this is untested)
from the <KasperSource>/Kassiopeia/Documentation directory using:

$ sphinx-build -b latex ./Reference ./build

This latex source file can then be turned into a .pdf document using pdflatex.

The sphinx documetation requires doxygen, python and sphinx.
The python document generator (sphinx) can be installed using:

# pip install "sphinx<7"

the Kassiopeia user-guide also requires sphinxjp.themes.basicstrap and sphinx_rtd_theme (for theme and style)
and Doxylink (in order to allow the Doxygen generated API reference to be visible in the user guide).
These can be installed using:

# pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
# pip install sphinxjp.themes.basicstrap
# pip install sphinxcontrib-doxylink
