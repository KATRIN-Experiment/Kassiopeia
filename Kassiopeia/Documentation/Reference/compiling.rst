Getting starting with Kassiopiea
**********************************

Downloading the code
====================

The most recent version of *Kassiopeia* and its accompanying libraries can be found on its public github page
located at:

https://github.com/KATRIN-Experiment/Kassiopeia

To obtain the code you may either download a .zip file containing the compressed source files from:

https://github.com/KATRIN-Experiment/Kassiopeia/archive/master.zip

or, alternatively, use git to clone the repository with the following command::

    $ git clone https://github.com/KATRIN-Experiment/Kassiopeia.git

The use of git is generally the preferred method as this will allow you to easily obtain updates
and bug fixes without needing to download a fresh copy of the source.
This can be done simply by executing the command::
$ git pull
from within the source directory. If you do not have the git software you may
install it on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system through the package manager with
the the following command::

    $ sudo apt-get install git

Supported operating systems and hardware requirements
=====================================================

*Kassiopeia* is supported and intended to run on systems running either Linux or MacOS X. Currently, it
has been compiled and tested to run on fresh installations of the Linux distributions Debian 8.6 and Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS.
It is also expected to compile and run on other Linux distributions, however this has not been tested, and
the steps needed to compile *Kassiopeia* may deviate from what is outlined here.

For minimal functionality and the ability to run the included example programs and simulations the following
computer specifications or better are recommended:

- Architecture: x86-64
- CPU: Intel Core i3 @ 2.0 GHz
- RAM: 4 GB
- Free Disk Space: 10 GB

Required software dependencies
==============================

*Kassiopeia* has been designed with an eye towards keeping reliance on external
software packages and libraries to a minimum. That being said, there are a few packages which are required
in order to build the software the comes in *Kassiopeia* distribution.
The first and most obvious is a C/C++ compiler which is new enough
to support the C++11 standard. The two recommended compilers are gcc/g++ and clang. The minimum required
versions are gcc 4.6 and clang 3.0.
Secondly, in order to build *Kassiopeia*, GNU make and cmake version 2.8.6 or greater is needed.
The *Kassiopeia* build system is based on the flexible cmake system which can be configured by
the command line. However, it is extremely useful to install the command line
curses-based cmake GUI interface in order to easily configure optional dependencies.

On a Debian/Ubuntu Linux system the minimum software packages required by the Kassiopiea
build system can be installed through the use of the package manager through the following command::

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui

Beyond the build system, there are only two software packages which could be considered absolutely
required dependencies, GSL_ and ROOT_ (though this is not strictly true, if the user only wishes to compile *KEMField*).

The GNU scientific library (GSL_), which is a collection of extremely useful numerical routines.
We recommend compiling and installing GSL_ from the source if possible.
However, the necessary libraries can be installed on Debian/Ubuntu linux with following command::

    $ sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev

The second required dependency is the ROOT_ software from CERN. While ROOT_ is not strictly required (e.g. if you
are only interested in using *Kassiopeia* as a library for some external application), it does feature
quite heavily as a means of saving simulation output data. Therefore, if you plan on saving the results
and performing any analysis of *Kassiopeia* simulation results you will need to install ROOT_.

It is recommended that you install ROOT_ by downloading and compiling the source code according
to the instructions on the CERN website. *Kassiopeia* requires ROOT_ to be built with XML support,
and ROOT_ itself requires the X11, Xft, Xpm, and Xext development libraries. You may install
the minimal set of development packages needed by ROOT on Debian/Ubuntu Linux by running the following command::

    $ sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxpm-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev libxml2-dev

After compiling and installing ROOT, in order to compile *Kassiopeia* on Linux,
your ``$PATH`` and ``$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environmental variables should be configured such that you can
run the executables ``root`` and ``root-config`` from the command line. The configuration of
these environmental variables is typically handled by ensuring that
the script ``thisroot.sh`` (distributed with the ROOT source code) is executed upon login. On Linux
this an be done by adding the following (with the appropriate change to the file path)
to your login script (``~/.bashrc`` file)::

    #Set up the ROOT environmental variables
    source <path-to-ROOT-install>/bin/thisroot.sh

Once you have GSL_ and ROOT_ installed, if you do not require any additional features,
you can then proceed with configuring and compiling *Kassiopeia*.

Compiling the code using CMake
==============================

After installing the required dependencies,
compiling a basic plain-vanilla version of *Kassiopeia*, with no extra features
is a relatively simple process. For the sake of simplicity, this guide will
assume that the *Kassiopeia* source code is located in the user's home directory
in ``~/Kassiopeia``.

To start, first ``cd`` into Kassiopeia's source directory
and create a ``build`` folder to hold the temporary files that will be created during compilation
by executing the commands::

    $ cd ~/Kassiopeia
    $ mkdir ./build
    $ cd ./build

Before running cmake, consider if you have a preference for which compiler is used.
You may select the compiler by setting the environmental variables ``CXX`` and ``CC``.
For example, for clang you should set them to::

    export CXX=clang++
    export CC=clang

while for the gcc toolchain use::

    export CXX=g++
    export CC=gcc

Once you are within the build directory, you may bring up the cmake configuration GUI by typing::

    $ ccmake ../

You will be presented with screen which looks like this:

.. image:: cmake_empty_cache.png
   :width: 500pt

Hit ``c`` to configure the build, this will lead to a screen as below.

.. image:: cmake_initial_config.png
   :width: 500pt

At this point you may either accept the default values or
use the arrow keys to select which option you wish to change. Press the ``enter`` key
to activate/deactive an option for modification. The installation directory
for the *Kassiopeia* software can be specified by setting the value of
the option CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Once the configuration variable are set
or if you accept the defaults, hit ``c`` to configure again, and then ``g`` to generate
the make file and exit. Once the make file
is generated, you can compile and install *Kassiopeia* by simply executing::

    make && make install

As compilation can take some time, you may use multiple CPU cores to accelerate the compilation,
by passing ``make`` the ``-j`` option (e.g ``make -j 4 install`` to compile using four CPU cores).


Directory structure and environmental variables
===============================================

Once compiled, the complete set of *Kassiopiea* executables and configuration files will be
found in the specified installation directory. The installation directory is broken
down into several components, these are:

- bin
- cache
- config
- data
- doc
- include
- lib
- log
- output
- scratch

The *Kassiopeia* executable can be found under the ``bin`` directory. Also in this directory
is the script ``kasperenv.sh``, which can be used to configure all the necessary environmental variables
needed to run *Kassiopeia*, by executing ``source ./kasperenv.sh`` at the command prompt.

The ``bin`` directory also contains other executables useful for interacting with the sub-components of
*Kassiopeia* such as the *KEMField* or *KGeoBag* libraries.

The ``lib`` directory contains all of the compiled libraries, as well as cmake and pkgconfig modules to enable
linking against *Kassiopeia* by external programs. The ``include`` directory contains all of the header files
of the compiled program.

The other directories: ``cache, config, data, doc, log, output,`` and ``scratch`` are all further sub-divided
into parts which relate to each sub-module of the code: *Kassiopeia*, *Kommon*, *KGeoBag*, or *KEMField*. The
``cache`` and ``scratch`` directories are responsible for storing temporary files needed during run time for
later reuse. The ``data`` directory contains raw data distributed with *Kassiopeia* needed for certain calculations
(e.g. molecular hydrogen scattering cross sections). The ``log`` directory provides space to collect logging output
from simulations, while the ``output`` directory is where simulation output is saved unless otherwise specified.

Once you have finished installing *Kassiopeia* and setting up
the appropriate environmental variables you can attempt to run it (without arguments)
by doing::

    cd <path-to-Kassiopeia-install>/bin/
    ./Kassiopeia

The output of which should be::

    usage: ./Kassiopeia <config_file_one.xml> [<config_file_one.xml> <...>] [ -r variable1=value1 variable2=value ... ]

If you receive error (either immediately, or at some later time) starting with the following::

    [INITIALIZATION ERROR MESSAGE] variable <KASPERSYS> is not defined

then you need to (re)execute the ``kasperenv.sh`` script to ensure the environmental variables are set up properly.
In order to auto-initialize these environmental variables upon login, the user
may add the following::

    #Set up the Kassiopeia environmental variables
    source <path-to-Kassiopeia-install>/bin/kasperenv.sh

to their login (``~/.bashrc``) script.


Configuring optional dependencies
=================================

*Kassiopeia* has a plethora of optional dependencies which provide additional
capabilities and enhance the performance of the software. This optional dependencies
are configurable through the cmake GUI interface. However, some of these optional
settings require additional libraries or special hardware in order to operate.

The use of some external libraries, (e.g. ROOT_ and VTK_) is collectively toggled
for all sub-modules at once. The *Kassiopeia* simulation software can link against
these libraries using the *KASPER* flags outlined in the table below:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Collective options                                                                                      |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| CMake option name  | Required software                     | Description                                |
+====================+=======================================+============================================+
| KASPER_USE_BOOST   | Boost_ developer libraries            | Build Boost dependent extensions.          |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| KASPER_USE_GSL     |  The GNU scientific library (GSL_)    | Build GSL dependent extensions             |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| KASPER_USE_ROOT    | The CERN ROOT_ libraries              | Build ROOT dependent extensions.           |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| KASPER_USE_TBB     |  Intel (TBB_) thread building blocks  | Build TBB_ based parallel processing tools.|
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| KASPER_USE_VTK     |  Kitware's visualization toolkit VTK_ | Build advanced tools for visualization.    |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

By default, the ``KASPER_USE_ROOT`` and ``KASPER_USE_GSL`` flags are turned on,
reflecting their importance for the default configuration of *Kassiopeia*.

Toggling of additional optional dependencies is very granular and may be enabled/disabled
for the individual sub-modules: (*Kassiopeia*, *Kommon*, *KEMField, or *KGeoBag*). It is important
to note changes in one sub-module may affect others since there is some interdependence between optional
features across sub-modules. This is automatically
accounted for by the cmake system in order to prevent situations where prerequisites are missing.
To summarize the possible optional dependencies that are available, they
have been divided according to the sub-module(s) which they modify. For performance reasons
all of the sub-modules explicitly allow the toggling of debugging
messages (which are disabled by default).

The *Kassiopeia* sub-module has a rather limited set of additional options, which is:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Kassiopeia options                                                                                          |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| CMake option name      | Required software                     | Description                                |

+------------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

The optional dependencies the *Kommon* sub-module are given in the following table:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Kommon options                                                                                          |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| KGeoBag options                                                                                          |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| CMake option name   | Required software                     | Description                                |
+=====================+=======================================+============================================+
| KGeoBag_ENABLE_DEBUG| None                                  | Enable KGeoBag debugging messages.         |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| KGeoBag_ENABLE_TEST | None                                  | Build developer test executables.          |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

It should be noted that if you have any interest in visualizing the data output from a Kassiopiea simulation,
the use of the VTK_ toolkit is highly recommended.
