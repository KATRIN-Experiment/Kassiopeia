				if true, the interaction will split tracks whenever a scattering occurs.

			density:
				the name of a density which has been added to the toolbox above.

			calculator:
				the name of a calculator which has been added to the toolbox above.

			calculators:
				the name of a tag containing calculators which has been added to the toolbox above.

     description:
     this is the condensed form of the main scattering interaction for kassiopeia.

		elements:
			density_constant:
				builds a constant density.

			calculator_constant:
				builds a constant calculator.

			calculator_hydrogen:
				builds a set of hydrogen calculators.

				parameters:
					elastic:
						if true, all elastic processes are enabled.

					excitation:
						if true, all excitation processes are enabled.

					ionisation:
						if true, all ionisation processes are enabled. note british spelling!
						
					molecule:
						if set to tritium, the rot20 calculator is also added
     
            calculator_ion:
                builds an ion calculator, used for ionization of gas by ions
                this affects the following ions: H^+, H_2^+, H_3^+, H^-
                                                 D^+, D_2^+, D_3^+, D^-
                                                 T^+, T_2^+, T_3^+, T^-
     
                parameters:
					gas:
                        set the name of the gas species to be used. 
                        only H_2 is available at present and is used by default.
