Shapes and assemblies
---------------------

To understand the basics of *KGeoBag*, let us look at a simple  example. A typical simulation geometry may look like
the image below, where multiple spaces (B-D) and surfaces (a-b) are assembled and placed in a "world" space A:

.. image:: _images/geometry_picture.png
   :width: 250pt

Internally, *KGeoBag* manages its geometric elements and their relations as a stree structure:

.. image:: _images/geometry_tree.png
   :width: 250pt

Now, to understand how this works in practice, we'll look at one of the example files provided with *Kassiopeia*. Of
the example files provided, the ``DipoleTrapSimulation.xml`` has the simplest geometry. It will be explained in detail
below, in order to walk you through a typical geometry configuration.

The geometry section starts off with a description of each shapes involved:

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- world -->

    <cylinder_space name="world_space" z1="-2." z2="2." r="2."/>

    <!-- solenoid -->

    <tag name="magnet_tag">
        <cylinder_tube_space
            name="solenoid_space"
            z1="-1.e-2"
            z2="1.e-2"
            r1="0.5e-2"
            r2="1.5e-2"
            radial_mesh_count="30"
        />
    </tag>

    <!-- ring -->

    <tag name="electrode_tag">
        <cylinder_surface
            name="ring_surface"
            z1="-2.0e-2"
            z2="2.0e-2"
            r="2.5e-1"
            longitudinal_mesh_count="200"
            longitudinal_mesh_power="3."
            axial_mesh_count="128"
        />
    </tag>

    <!-- tube -->

    <tag name="electrode_tag">
        <cylinder_surface
            name="tube_surface"
            z1="-1.e-2"
            z2="1.e-2"
            r="0.5e-2"
            longitudinal_mesh_count="200"
            longitudinal_mesh_power="3."
            axial_mesh_count="128"
        />
    </tag>

    <!-- target -->

    <tag name="target_tag">
        <disk_surface name="target_surface" r="1.0e-2" z="0."/>
    </tag>

    <!-- center -->

    <tag name="center_tag">
        <disk_surface name="center_surface" r="2.5e-1" z="0."/>
    </tag>

The individual shapes are defined by elements of the common structure:

.. code-block:: xml

    <some_space name="my_space"/>
    <some_surface name="my_surface"/>

where each element is given a name, which it can be referenced with, and additional parameters dependeing on the shape.
For example, the disk surface is defined by only two parameters `r` and `z`, while other shapes differ.

Tagging system
--------------

The tagging system is used to group different elements together, for example by distinguishng between magnet and
electrode shapes. These tags will be used later to retrieve elements and pass them to the *KEMField* module. The
general syntax is:

.. code-block:: xml

    <tag name="my_tag" name="another_tag">
        <shape name="my_shape"/>
    </tag>

and tags can be freely combined or re-used.

Assembling elements
-------------------

The defined shapes are then placed into an assembly of the experiment geometry. Geometric objects are placed by
referencing each shape by its given (and *unique*) name and placing it inside a space. This can be combined with
specifying a transformation (relative to the assembly origin) defining the location and orientation of each object. The
available transformation types are displacements (defined by a 3-vector), and rotations (defined by an axis-angle
pair, or a series of Euler angles using the *Z-Y'-Z''* convention):

.. code-block:: xml

    <space name="dipole_trap_assembly">
        <surface name="ring" node="ring_surface"/>
        <surface name="center" node="center_surface"/>
        <space name="downstream_solenoid" node="solenoid_space">
            <transformation displacement="0. 0. -0.5"/>
        </space>
        <surface name="downstream_tube" node="tube_surface">
            <transformation displacement="0. 0. -0.5"/>
        </surface>
        <surface name="upstream_target" node="target_surface">
            <transformation displacement="0. 0. -0.48"/>
        </surface>
        <space name="upstream_solenoid" node="solenoid_space">
            <transformation displacement="0. 0. 0.5"/>
        </space>
        <surface name="upstream_tube" node="tube_surface">
            <transformation displacement="0. 0. 0.5"/>
        </surface>
        <surface name="downstream_target" node="target_surface">
            <transformation displacement="0. 0. 0.48"/>
        </surface>
    </space>

Here the individual named shapes that were defined earlier are referenced, using the general syntax:

.. code-block:: xml

    <space name="my_assembly">
        <space name="my_placed_space" node="my_space"/>
    </space>

and spaces can be freely nested, which is one of the key features of *KGeoBag*. Note the difference between the first
space, which does not refer to any shape and just holds the child elements, and the second space which refers to the
shape named ``my_space`` through the `node` attribute. The ``my_assembly`` space can be though of as a "virtual space",
without any reference to a real geometric object.

Finally in the ``DipoleTrapSimulation.xml`` file, the full assembly is placed within the world volume:

.. code-block:: xml

    <space name="world" node="world_space">
        <space name="dipole_trap" tree="dipole_trap_assembly"/>
    </space>

The world volume is a crucial part of any geometry, since it defines the outermost "root" space in which all other
elements must be placed. Note that in this case, the space named ``dipole_trap_assembly`` is referenced through the
`tree` attribute (and not `node`, as you might expect.) This is due to the fact that the assembly is a "virtual" space
that just holds its child elements, but does not refer to an actual object. Make sure to keep this in mind for your
own geometry configurations!

Transformations
---------------

It should be noted that transformations applied to an assembly are collectively applied to all of the geometric elements
within the assembly. For example, placing the dipole trap assembly within the world volume as:

.. code-block:: xml

    <space name="world" node="world_space">
        <space name="dipole_trap" tree="dipole_trap_assembly">
            <transformation rotation_euler="90. 0. 0." displacement="0 0 1.0"/>
        </space>
    </space>

would rotate the whole assembly by 90 degrees about the z-axis, and then displace it by 1 meter along the z-axis.

Assemblies may be nested within each other, and the coordinate transformations which are associated with the placement
of each assembly will be appropriately applied to all of the elements they contain. This makes it very intuitive to
create complex geometries with multiple displacements and rotations, because it resembles the behavior of real-world
objects (i.e. turning an assemble object by some amount will also turn all parts inside by the same amount, relative
to the outside coordinate system.)

Especially for rotations, it should be noted that it makes a difference if they are applied in the assembly before or
after placing child elements. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <disk_surface name="disk_surface" r="1.0" z="0."/>

    <space name="world">
        <space name="assembly_1">
            <surface name="placed_disk" node="disk_surface"/>
            <transformation rotation_euler="0. 30. 0." displacement="0 0 -1.0"/>
        </space>
        <space name="assembly_2">
            <transformation rotation_euler="0. 30. 0." displacement="0 0 1.0"/>
            <surface name="placed_disk" node="disk_surface"/>
        </space>
    </space>

In this case, the ``placed_disk`` in in the first assembly will be tilted relative to the world volume, while the
disk in the second assembly will not! This can be verified easily with one of the geometry viewers, which are explained
in section  :ref:`kgeobag-visualization`. The reason for this behavior is that in the second case, the rotation was
applied before placing the surface inside the assembly, and so it is not propagated to the shape. This is on purpose,
because it allows to transform the origin and orientation of the reference system before assembling elements.

It is best to think of the ``<transformation>`` elements as commands that are executed during XML initialization, while
the geometry is assembled. It should be clear then that the two example assemblies yield different results.

Extensions
-----------

In order to give physical properties to the geometry elements that have been constructed and placed, they must be
associated with extensions. The currently available extensions are *meshing* (axially or rotationally symmetric, or
non-symmetric), *visualization* properties, electrostatic *boundary conditions* (Dirichlet or Neumann surfaces), and
magnetostatic properties of *solenoids and coils* (current density and number of windings.)

A simple extension example is specifying the color and opacity of a shape for its display in a VTK_ visualization window
as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <appearance name="app_magnet" color="0 255 127 127" arc="72" surfaces="world/dipole_trap/@magnet_tag"/>

This example tells the visualization that any shape given the tag ``magnet_tag`` should be colored with an RGBA color
value of (0,255,127,127), where all values are given in the range 0..255 and the fourth value defines the shape's
opacity. If you have VTK enabled you may wish to experiment with the changes introduced by modifying these parameters.
When using the ROOT_ visualization, the appearance settings will be ignored.

In the line above, you also find an example of referencing tags throught the ``@tag_name`` syntax. Generally the
placed shapes can be referenced through a XPath_-like syntax that defines the location in the geometry tree, starting
at the "root" volume (which is typically called `world`.) This usually works with all `spaces` and `surfaces`
attributes of the XML elements.

The tagging feature is very useful for applying properties to many different elements at once. To do this, each element
which is to receive the same extension must share the same tag. There is no limit to the number of tags an geometric
element may be given. For example, given the dipole trap geometry as specified, one may associate an axially symmetric
mesh with all elements that share the tag ``electrode_tag`` with the line:

.. code-block:: xml

    <axial_mesh name="mesh_electrode" surfaces="world/dipole_trap/@electrode_tag"/>

This specifies that any geometric shape with the tag ``electrode_tag`` that is found within the ``world/dipole_trap``
space should be giving an axial mesh extension (i.e. it will be divided into a collection of axially symmetric objects
like cones, cylinders, etc.) This axial mesh will be later used by the field solving routines in *KEMField*. However, a
tag is not strictly necessary to apply an extension. For example, if we wished to generate an axial mesh for everything
within the world volume we would write:

.. code-block:: xml

    <axial_mesh name="mesh_electrode" surfaces="world/#"/>

or, if we wished to single out the ``ring_surface`` shape by specifying its full path we would write:

.. code-block:: xml

     <axial_mesh name="mesh_electrode" surfaces="world/dipole_trap/ring"/>

Meshing is critical for any problem with involves electrostatic fields. The type of mesh depends on the symmetry of the
geometry. For completely axially-symmetric geometries, the ``axial_mesh`` is recommended so that the zonal harmonics
field computation method may be used. For completely non-symmetric (3D) geometries, the mesh type would be specified as
follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <mesh name="mesh_electrode" surfaces="world/dipole_trap/@electrode_tag"/>

Because of the very shape-specific nature of the deterministic meshing which is provided by *KGeoBag*, parameters
(``mesh_count`` and ``mesh_power``) describing how the mesh is to be constructed are given when specifying the shapes
themselves. That being said, the mesh associated with a specific shape will not be constructed unless the extension
statement is present.

It is possible to define multiple meshes side by side, e.g. if the simulation can be configured axially-symmetric or
non-symmetric. In this case, both meshes will be available for *KEMField* calculations regardless of the symmetry
setting. Note that the axial mesh cannot handle any non-symmetric elements, and these will be simply ignored.

Another important extension for field calculations is the specification of boundary conditions. For example, when
solving the Laplace boundary value problem via *KEMField*, one may specify that a particular surface exhibit Dirichlet
boundary conditions where a particular voltage is applied to the surface through the use of the following extension:

.. code-block:: xml

    <electrostatic_dirichlet name="electrode_ring" surfaces="world/dipole_trap/ring" value="-10."/>

Where ``value="-10"`` signifies that this surface has a potential of -10 volts. This is the standard case for defining
(metallic) electrode surfaces in a simulation, and a typical scenario for the boundary-element method (BEM). It is also
possible to define Neumann boundary conditions, which are typically used for insulating materials.

Similar to the electrode setup, one can define a magnet system that provides a magnetostatic field for the simulation.
For example, one may specify a solenoid electromagnet with the appropriate parameters:

.. code-block:: xml

    <electromagnet name="electromagnet_upstream_solenoid" spaces="world/dipole_trap/upstream_solenoid" current="{22.3047 * 20000}"/>

which references a space named ``upstream_solenoid`` with a total current of 22.3047 amps times 20000 turns. The
electric current and the number of turns can also be specified separately for added clarity:

.. code-block:: xml

    <electromagnet name="electromagnet_upstream_solenoid" spaces="world/dipole_trap/upstream_solenoid" current="22.3047" num_turns="20000"/>

The cylinder tube space is one of the supported shapes for electromagnets and describes a solenoid geometry. Other
supported shapes are the cylinder surface, describing a simple coil, and the rod space, describing a single wire.
