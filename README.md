Kassiopeia: Simulation of electric and magnetic fields and particle tracking
============================================================================

--------------------------------------------------
 System requirements:
--------------------------------------------------

    Linux/MacOS (Windows+cygwin should work too, but has not been tested)

    Some dependencies are only required if certain module are compiled in.

    Dependencies:
        CMake (www.cmake.org) version 2.8 or higher
        G++ version 4.5 or higher (if compiling with GCC)
        GSL (www.gnu.org/software/gsl)
        ROOT (www.cern.ch/root) version 5.24 or higher (6.x should work too)
            --enable-minuit2 (if you want to use KaFit)
            --enable-fftw3 (if you want to use KEMField)

    Optional Dependencies:
        Boost (www.boost.org) version 1.46 or higher
        LibXml2 (xmlsoft.org)
        Log4CXX (logging.apache.org/log4cxx)
        MPI (www.open-mpi.org or mpich.org)
        OpenCL (www.khronos.org/opencl), installation details depend on your system
        OpenSSL (openssl.org) version 0.9.6 or higher
        PETSc (mcs.anl.gov/petsc)
        VTK (www.vtk.org) version 5.0 or higher
        zlib (www.zlib.net)
        pdflatex (for making the documentation; minimum version not known)
        doxygen (for making the documentation; minimum version not known)


--------------------------------------------------
 Installation
--------------------------------------------------

    1. Make a separate directory for the build tree, and enter that directory:
            > mkdir build
            > cd build

    1.5. Consider setting important environmental variables now.
        Selecting a specific compiler to be configured 
        by CMake is done for example by
            > export CXX=clang++
            > export CC=clang
        to use the Clang/LLVM compiler, or
            > export CXX=g++
            > export CC=gcc
        to use the GNU compiler (GCC).

    2. Run cmake (or ccmake, or cmake-gui, if you prefer):
            > cmake ..

    2.5. If applicable, make any changes you need to the configuration, 
         and (re)generate the makefiles. e.g. You may want to change the 
         install prefix (NOTE: most users will probably want to do this).
         The default is <Source-Directory>/install. If you're not doing 
         a general install for your system, or if you just want to use 
         a different location, you should change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX 
         to your desired location. Note the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. 
         If you do not plan to debug kasper applications, 
         'Release' will give you the best execution performance.
         If you use one of the GUI variants (ccmake or cmake-gui), 
         you can just go through a list of all the available build options. 
         Most options also have a short description. Note that some variables 
         have dependencies (e.g. BUILD_KASSIOPEIA will also enable BUILD_KEMFIELD).

    3. Then type
            > make
        to start the build process. This can take some time, 
        depending on the modules you activated in CMake.
        If you have more than one CPU core on your system, 
        you can build several files in parallel:
            > make -j2
        Make sure to keep the number passed to 'make' smaller 
        than the number of actual CPU cores.

    4. Install the executables and libraries with
            > make install
        Executables are installed in the bin/ directory, 
        and libraries are installed in the lib/ directory.

    5. Include kasperenv.sh in your .bashrc with 
            > source /path/to/Kasper/install/bin/kasperenv.sh 
       This script adds the bin/ directory to your $PATH so you 
       can call executables directly from the commandline.
       Furthermore this sets the $KASPERSYS environment variable.

 Docker container
--------------------------------------------------

    1. A Docker container with Kasper is available at
        https://hub.docker.com/r/katrinexperiment/kassiopeia
    2. This Docker container can be used with Docker
       (with superuser privileges).
        A. Pull the container to your system with
            > sudo docker pull katrinexperiment/kassiopeia
        B. Open a shell inside the container with
            > sudo docker run --rm -it katrinexperiment/kassiopeia /bin/bash
    3. The Docker container can also be used with Singularity
       (as a regular user).
        A. Pull the container to your system with
            > singularity pull docker://katrinexperiment/kassiopeia
        B. Open a shell inside the container with
            > singularity shell docker://katrinexperiment/kassiopeia
           or (if a local copy is available already)
            > singularity shell kassiopeia-latest.sif
    4. Build the container locally with
        > sudo docker build -t katrinexperiment/kassiopeia .
       and upload the local container to Docker Hub with
        > sudo docker push katrinexperiment/kassiopeia
